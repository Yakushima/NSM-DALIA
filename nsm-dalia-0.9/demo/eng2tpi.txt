This file contains a review of basic canonic sentences, which NSM-DALIA
can translate  from English into Tok Pisin.

To process the file in NSM-DALIA, first load English as L1 and Tok Pisin
as L2:


==
DALIA> l(eng).
 ** eng:e language module loaded.
 ** Current L1 set to eng:e

DALIA> l2(tpi).
 ** tpi:e language module loaded.
 ** Current L2 set to tpi:e
==


Then, if you issue the command:

==
DALIA> pf("demo/eng2tpi.txt").
==

you will have this file displayed in the PROLOG terminal,
with the English NSM text replaced by its Tok Pisin equivalent.

If you want to send the results to a text file, before the
"parse_file" command, set an output file like this:

==
DALIA> so("myOutputFile.txt").
==


Sentences between a @t tag and an @e tag are translated
from L1 to L2:

@t
God is someone.
@e
